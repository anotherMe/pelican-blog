<p>I am facing DNS resolving issue when I connect to my office VPN ( OpenVPN ) using Network Manager: it seems I cannot use my company DNS.</p>
<p>In spite of my efforts trying to force the use of my company DNS, either trying to modify openvpn config file or trying to set DNS in network-manager GUI, still /etc/resolv.conf present no trace of wanted DNS servers.</p>
<p>I managed to resolve this issue by editing:</p>
<pre>/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf</pre>
<p>and commenting out the *dnsmasq* line:</p>
<pre>[main]
plugins=ifupdown,keyfile,ofono
#dns=dnsmasq

[ifupdown]
managed=false</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
