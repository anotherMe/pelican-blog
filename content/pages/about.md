# Hello

My name is Marco. I'm a programmer (mostly), based in [Genoa](https://goo.gl/maps/BWe7zr22vgjNHHMR7).

I call myself a full stack programmer: I'm at ease on client code ([Javascript](http://vanilla-js.com/),
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/), [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) ) and on server code ( [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/), [Spring](https://spring.io/) ). I'm also on solid ground when talking SQL ( once [SQLServer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server) now mostly [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) )

[Python](https://www.python.org/) has been a long time love.

My duties involve sometimes taking care of [systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) and
[networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network).

When I'm at the keyboard, I'm usually on [Linux OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux).
